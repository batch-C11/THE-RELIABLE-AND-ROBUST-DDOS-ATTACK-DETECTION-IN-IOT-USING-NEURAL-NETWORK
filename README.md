# THE-RELIABLE-AND-ROBUST-DDOS-ATTACK-DETECTION-IN-IOT-USING-NEURAL-NETWORK

STEP 1:Firstly.We have to create two dataset.One for attack and other for normal.(Here we have 1 lakhs dataset on each).

STEP 2:Open ANACONDA PROMPT,Define Path and Type JUPYTER NOTEBOOK.

STEP 3:Jupyter Notebook act as IDE and also as presentation tool.It is open source web app based on client-server structure.

STEP 4:Here,Numpy is used to support mathematical functions for multidimensional arrays.

STEP 5:Pandas is open source package that consists of lot of built-in function,used for data analysis and machine learning.

STEP 6:Other than these,We are using MATPLOTLIB and SEABORN for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.

STEP 7:Using tree map,We can find where the attack take place in defined way.

STEP 8:Then Heat map defines whether attack takes place in colour difference method.

STEP 9:First we have to train the dataset then test it.

STEP 10:Hence we got output and accuracy.
